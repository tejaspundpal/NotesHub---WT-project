                <h2>What Is a Data Science ?</h2>
                <p>A field that deals with unstructured, structured data, and semi-structured data. It involves
                    practices like data cleansing, data preparation, data analysis, and much more.<br><br>

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data science is the combination of statistics, mathematics,
                        programming, and problem-solving;
                        capturing data in ingenious ways; the ability to look at things differently; and the activity of
                        cleansing, preparing, and aligning data.</span><br><br>

                    Therefore, a data science roadmap is a visual representation of a strategic plan designed to help
                    the aspiring IT professional learn about and succeed in the field of data science.

                <h2>Learn About Applied Statistics and Mathematics</h2>
                <p>Statistical methods are an integral part of data science, where most data science interviews focus on
                    inferential and descriptive statistics. Mathematics and statistics smooth the road to a better
                    understanding of how algorithms work.<br><br>

                    Therefore, at this stage of your data science roadmap, you should focus on mastering the following:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Descriptive Statistics:</b> Learn about location estimates (mean, median, mode, trimmed
                        statistics, and weighted statistics), and variability used to describe data.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Inferential statistics:</b> This form of statistics involves defining business metrics, A/B
                        tests, designing hypothesis tests, and analyzing collected data and experiment results using
                        confidence intervals, p-value, and alpha values.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Algebra and Single and Multi-Variate Calculus:</b> These subjects help you better understand
                        gradient, loss functions, and optimizers used in machine learning.</li><br>

                <h2>Learning About Programming or Software Engineering</h2>
                <p>As you begin your data science journey, you must have a solid foundation. The data science field
                    requires skill and experience in either software engineering or programming. You should learn a
                    minimum of one programming language, such as

                Programming Topics to Include
                Data scientists should learn about common data structures (e.g., dictionaries, data types, lists, sets,
                tuples), searching and sorting algorithms, logic, control flow, writing functions, object-oriented
                programming, and how to work with external libraries.<br><br>

                Additionally, aspiring data scientists should be familiar with using <b>Git and GitHub-related
                    elements</b> such as terminals and version control.<br>Check out this Github repo: <a

                <h2>Learning About Data Collection and Cleaning</h2>
                <p>Data scientists are often required to find appropriately valuable data that solves problems. They
                    collect this data from many different sources, including APIs, databases, publicly available data
                    repositories, and even scraping if the site permits it.<br><br>

                    However, the data gathered from these sources is rarely ready to use. Instead, it needs to be
                    cleaned and formatted before it's used, using tools such as a multi-dimensional array, data frame
                    manipulation, or employing scientific and descriptive computations. Data scientists typically use
                    libraries like Pandas and NumPy to help turn the information from raw, unformatted data to
                    ready-to-analyze data.<br><br>

                <p>
                    Time to move on to the next stage of your data science roadmap: data analysis and storytelling. Data
                    analysts, who share a strong affinity with data scientists, draw insights from data, then relay
                    their findings to management in easy-to-understand terms and visualizations.<br><br>

                    As they relate to storytelling, the above responsibilities require proficiency in data visualization
                    (plotting data using libraries like plotly or seaborn) and strong communication skills. In addition,
                    you should learn:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Business acumen: Practice asking questions that target business metrics. Additionally, practice
                        writing concise and clear reports, business-related blogs, and presentations.
                    </li><br>
                    <li>Dashboard development: This subject entails using Excel or specialized tools such as Power BI
                        and Tableau to construct dashboards that summarize or aggregate data that helps management make
                        informed actionable decisions.</li><br>
                    <li>Exploratory data analysis: This knowledge covers defining questions, formatting, filtering,
                        handling missing values, outliers, and univariate and multi-variate analysis.</li><br>
